This repository contains a simple Hack program that demonstrates a runtime error due to the dynamic typing nature of the language.  The program compiles without errors but throws an exception at runtime when attempting to add an integer and a string. This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in dynamically-typed languages like Hack to avoid unexpected runtime behavior. The solution demonstrates how to add runtime type checking to prevent this error.
